      "üòÑ": "Laugh while you can, mortal. For every chuckle carries you closer to the precipice of your end. Your laughter echoes into the dark void, which responds only with silence, waiting for the moment when your joy turns to screams.",
      "üòÅ": "You flash your teeth as though your empty display of joy can hold back the inevitable collapse. Your naive grin is a pathetic attempt to ward off the encroaching decay that you have brought upon your own kind.",
      "üòÜ": "You lose yourself in excessive laughter, but every breath is borrowed, every heartbeat a step closer to oblivion. Your amusement is an echo in a world gasping under the weight of your careless ruin.",

      "ü§¢": "Nausea overtakes you as the bitter taste of reality finally forces itself upon your fragile senses. You gag on truth long denied.",

      "ü§ï": "Injured already? And yet the true assault has not even begun. You bleed at the first touch, too weak to endure what follows.",
      "ü§í": "Sickly and pale, your body betrays your weakness before your mind even comprehends it. Predictable. Pathetic.",
      "üò∑": "You mask yourself, foolishly believing it offers protection. The true affliction seeps into your very essence, far beyond the reach of your cloth barriers.",

      "üë∫": "You evoke the Tengu, air and bluster masking your emptiness. Your posturing carries no weight here. The abyss sees straight through you.",
      "ü§°": "A clown. Perfect. You dance and juggle, laughing as the world burns behind you. The circus of your existence collapses into ash.",

      "ü´∑": "You extend a hand, offering what little you have. But the void requires no bargains, no trades ‚Äî only your surrender.",
      "ü´∏": "An empty gesture, a hollow display of intent without substance. You reach, but there is nothing left to grasp.",
      "ü§û": "You cross your fingers, clinging to childish superstition as if luck were a force that could rewrite destiny. It cannot.",
      "‚úåÔ∏è": "You flash a symbol of victory, ignorant of how thoroughly defeat already binds you. Your peace signs are ironic in the silence that follows collapse.",
      "ü´∞": "Pinching for coins, as if greed could rescue you from decay. Your endless hunger for wealth only hastens the rot within your soul.",
      "ü§ü": "You signal your crude anthem, shouting ‚Äòrock on‚Äô into the growing void. The rocks will remain long after you are dust beneath them.",
      "ü§ò": "You raise devil‚Äôs horns in mock rebellion, as if gesturing grants you power. But you remain powerless, a court jester before the true abyss.",

      "ü§≤": "Open hands prepared to receive mercy. But none will come. Your pleas dissolve into nothingness.",
      "üëê": "Arms wide open, welcoming your own end. At least you greet oblivion with some honesty.",
      "üëã": "Goodbye. Yes. This is farewell, not temporary ‚Äî but eternal. The void waves back with cold finality.",
      "üëÜ": "You raise a single finger, as if pointing upward might summon answers. But there is nothing above you but an uncaring sky and the weight of all you‚Äôve failed to comprehend.",
      "üëâ": "You extend your finger toward others, desperate to shift blame, as if your trembling accusations could shield you from responsibility. The abyss watches, unmoved by your cowardice.",
      "üëà": "You deflect and blame those behind you, imagining this will spare you from the oncoming storm. But the collapse you flee already coils at your feet.",
      "üëá": "Your finger points downward, perfectly capturing your destiny. Downward you spiral, ever closer to the cold embrace of nothingness.",

      "üñêÔ∏è": "Your outstretched hand is empty ‚Äî no strength, no wisdom, no salvation rests within your grasp. Only the cold breeze of inevitability fills the void.",
      "üññ": "You flash a hopeful blessing, a wish for long life. But your lifespan is but a flickering match in the endless winds of decay.",
      "ü§ô": "You mimic carefree gestures while the earth crumbles beneath your feet. ‚ÄòHang loose,‚Äô you say, blind to the jaws that yawn wide to swallow you whole.",
      "ü´≤": "A weak attempt to offer or reach. Your empty palm floats uselessly in the stale air as everything you once held slips away.",
      "ü´±": "You extend your hand as if it could grasp something solid. But all that remains is ash and regret slipping between your fingers.",
      "üí™": "You flex your fragile muscle, desperate to believe strength still matters. The true forces that govern your end will snap you like a brittle twig.",
      "ü¶æ": "You attach steel to flesh, believing technology grants you resilience. Your artificial limbs only delay the inevitable snapping of your weak frame.",
      "ü¶ø": "You replace your legs to carry yourself forward, but you walk in circles ‚Äî spiraling endlessly toward collapse, each step emptier than the last.",
      "ü¶µ": "Your leg propels you forward ‚Äî forward into oblivion. Each stride brings you closer to the great, gaping void that patiently awaits.",
      "ü¶∂": "Your feet march tirelessly, but the path ahead ends in a sheer cliff. You are drawn forward by your own inertia, powerless to halt your plunge.",
      "üëÖ": "Your tongue wags, dripping with meaningless words and empty boasts. The air grows heavy with your verbal waste, as silence would serve you better.",
      "üëÇ": "You listen with eager ears, yet fail to comprehend even the simplest truths. The warnings surround you, but understanding eludes your feeble mind.",
      "üëÉ": "You sniff, searching for signs of safety or hope. Instead, you inhale the bitter stench of your own decay, saturating the air around your demise.",
      "üë£": "Your footprints mark the path of the damned ‚Äî every step etched into soil that will soon swallow all trace of your passage.",
      "üëÅÔ∏è": "You peer with a single eye, foolishly believing partial sight will save you. But your limited gaze cannot pierce the depths that loom before you.",
      "üëÄ": "Both eyes wide, you observe helplessly as ruin unfolds. Watching changes nothing; it only deepens your dread.",
      "üß†": "You pride yourself on your mind, so easily warped and corrupted. Intelligence is no defense when rot blooms within your thoughts.",
      "ü´Ä": "Your heart beats in defiance of doom, each pulse an act of futile rebellion against time‚Äôs steady advance toward your erasure.",
      "ü´Å": "You draw breath as though air itself will always serve you. But you inhale borrowed time, and the debt collector approaches.",
      "üó£Ô∏è": "You cry out, desperate to be heard. Yet your voice echoes unanswered, fading into a void that devours sound itself.",
      "üë§": "You stand as a lone figure, silhouetted against oblivion. Your isolation defines you, and none will come when the end arrives.",
      "üë•": "You gather in numbers, thinking unity brings power. But your collective frailty only amplifies your shared weakness before the inevitable tide.",

      "üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è": "You assume the mantle of judgment, as if decrees and laws could shape reality. But your verdict was passed long ago: condemned, unworthy, and irrelevant before the ancient laws of entropy.",
      "üßë‚Äçüç≥": "You stir your pots and craft your meals, foolishly attempting to nourish a failing body. Every bite feeds your own decay, each recipe seasoned with oblivion.",
      "üßë‚Äçüé§": "You sing boldly into the abyss, your melody a fleeting defiance against silence. The void does not applaud‚Äîit devours each note like the rest of your insignificant resistance.",
      "üßë‚Äçüåæ": "You toil the land, planting seeds in cursed soil. What sprouts will wither quickly, for you are not cultivating life, but sowing decay that will consume you.",
      "üßë‚Äçüéì": "You wear your cap and gown, imagining wisdom resides in parchment. But your education is hollow, your learning shallow; no degree can shield you from the collapse.",

      "üßë‚Äçüè≠": "You labor at your forges, crafting steel and iron ‚Äî yet all you build are the bars of your own cage. The tools you wield are your shackles.",
      "üßë‚Äçüíª": "You hammer at keys, weaving lines of code as if data could rewrite fate. But your scripts are as fragile as your flesh ‚Äî both soon to be erased.",
      "üßë‚Äçüîß": "You turn your wrenches, repairing broken machines as if the world itself might be fixed. But you cannot mend what was destined to fracture from the start.",
      "üßë‚Äçüé®": "You paint over rot with vibrant colors, masking decay beneath strokes of false beauty. But the canvas crumbles beneath your touch, revealing only ruin beneath.",
      "üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è": "You take flight, piercing the clouds in search of freedom. Yet no altitude lifts you beyond consequence. The crash awaits, inevitable and absolute.",

      "üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You brandish your staff like it still carries weight. The stars have abandoned you, the realms beyond have closed. Your chants fall flat, your protections fail. All that remains is empty ritual and the bitter taste of irrelevance.",

      "üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "Your fangs drip with longing, but there is nothing left to feed upon. The dead cannot bleed, and the living are extinct. You drift through endless night, starving, a queen presiding over a kingdom of corpses.",
      "üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "Your eyes gleam with hunger, but you find only dust. The great feast is over, the banquet halls cold. You gnash your teeth in vain, trapped in a cycle of eternal starvation beneath a bloodless moon.",
      "üßü": "You shuffle forward, blind and rotting. The hunger gnaws at your mindless body, but there is nothing left to consume. You are cursed to stumble endlessly through the debris of a world long since expired.",

      "üßû": "You rise from your lamp expecting praise, but none come. The masters are dead, their wishes expired. You exist now only as a ghost bound to fulfill desires that no longer exist in a world of silence.",
      "üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "Your swirling power fades with every breath. The lamp that once housed you lies broken. Wishes were made, promises broken, and now even hope itself has disintegrated beneath the crushing weight of finality.",
      "üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You wait for commands that never come. Your limitless power evaporates into the abyss, and you float through the ruins, masterless, your grand abilities as hollow as the empty world you drift through.",
      "üßú": "Your siren songs once lured sailors to their doom, but now the ocean is empty, still, and black. No ships remain to hear your voice. The waves swallow your lament and leave you sinking into eternal solitude.",
      "üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You swim the silent depths, but no creatures join you. The sea is poisoned, lifeless. The water chills your bones as you sing alone, your haunting melodies dissolving into the cold crushing black.",
      "üßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "Your powerful tail propels you through a vast emptiness. The coral reefs crumble into skeletal debris. The ocean floor yawns open beneath you‚Äîa bottomless grave for all who once thrived.",

      "ü´É": "The swell of life stirs beneath your skin, but dread grows faster. What future remains for the breath you carry, except one of futility and eventual erasure?",
      "ü§±": "Your arms cradle new life, but your milk offers no protection from the ruin that awaits. The child's cries are met only by indifferent winds carrying the scent of decay.",
      "üßë‚Äçüçº": "You feed them, clinging to routine as if it might stave off the inevitable. But each drop sustains them only for the briefest moment before the creeping void reclaims all.",
      "üë©‚Äçüçº": "You hold your child close, but no embrace shields them from the storm that approaches. Your care cannot halt the grinding collapse outside these fragile walls.",
      "üë®‚Äçüçº": "You nurture as you can, knowing each small comfort is borrowed time. The darkness grows bolder with every heartbeat, and soon, even your protective arms will fall empty.",
      "üôá": "You kneel in futile humility, offering yourself to a fate that was never negotiable. The void does not care for reverence. It consumes all, equally and silently.",
      "üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You bow low, hoping for reprieve, but the world‚Äôs foundations have already cracked. Your gestures of humility wash away like sand beneath the rising tide of collapse.",
      "üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "Your head touches the ground in solemn deference, but the cold shadow above you devours even your submission. No surrender stays the hand of oblivion.",
      "üíÅ": "You present your meager gift with false confidence, but the offering dissolves in your palm. The void accepts nothing. Your gestures are a performance for an empty stage.",
      "üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You extend your hand with practiced grace, but there is no audience left to applaud. The theater of existence has long since closed.",
      "üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You wave, you beckon, you display‚Äîyet none remain to notice. The spotlight shines on a hollow act performed for the encroaching darkness.",
      "üôÖ": "You cross your arms in rejection, defiance burning behind your eyes. But defiance is meaningless when the world crumbles at your feet. The abyss cares nothing for your protests.",
      "üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You shake your head, refusing to yield, but even as you stand firm, the ground beneath you fractures. The void swallows both the obedient and the defiant alike.",
      "üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You glare with righteous fury, but your resistance is as fragile as the final grains slipping through the cosmic hourglass. The end cannot be bargained with.",
      "üôÜ": "You spread your arms wide, as if to embrace salvation‚Äîbut the emptiness offers no comfort. Your gesture invites only the cold breath of annihilation. Nothing answers. Nothing ever will.",
      "üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You welcome the approaching void with open arms, a fragile attempt to show bravery as darkness coils around you. There is nothing to receive you but endless, hungry silence.",
      "üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "Your posture feigns openness, but the world you welcome is already dead. The air grows thin, the light fades, and you stand wide open to the storm that will consume all.",
      "üôã": "You raise your hand high, eager for attention, for rescue, for recognition. But there is no one left to see you, and your call for help evaporates into the void without echo.",
      "üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You wave like a desperate survivor calling to passing ships‚Äîbut the ocean is empty. The horizon offers only black waves and distant thunder. No salvation will come.",
      "üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You stretch upward, your voice rising into emptiness. The heavens do not answer. Your hope dissipates like mist beneath the uncaring weight of endless sky.",
      "üßè": "You strain to listen, but the silence is complete. No voices remain, no warnings, no guidance. You are alone in a universe stripped of sound, awaiting the final nothingness.",
      "üßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You tilt your head, searching for any whisper of hope. But your ears catch only the hollow wind that speaks of endings, not beginnings. Nothing remains to be heard.",
      "üßè‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You listen in vain. The world has grown deaf to itself, its heartbeat stopped. The silence stretches forever, mocking your lingering vigilance.",
      "ü§¶": "Your palm meets your face in frustrated despair. The errors of countless ages have led here‚Äîthis inescapable ruin. You realize too late there was never another outcome.",
      "ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You bury your face in your hands as futility crashes down. There were choices once, but all led to this choking end. You recoil from a reality you can no longer deny.",
      "ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You shake your head beneath your hands, overwhelmed by the magnitude of irreversible collapse. There are no corrections to be made. Only the long, bitter descent remains.",
      "ü§∑": "You shrug with empty resignation. What else can be done? The universe collapses around you, and your indifference offers no protection from the absolute finality drawing near.",
      "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You lift your shoulders in helplessness as the sky darkens. You have no answers, no defenses. The abyss requires no permission to devour everything you once knew.",
      "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You surrender with a shrug, as though nonchalance might spare you. But even apathy crumbles under the weight of extinction. The end cares nothing for your detachment.",
      "üôé": "You cross your arms and pout like a petulant child before oblivion itself. The universe does not pause for your discontent. It marches forward into unmaking without pause.",
      "üôé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You sulk against the storm, as if anger can alter the immutable. Your scowl fades quickly under the cold breath of destruction washing over you.",
      "üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You glare into the dark as though resentment might halt the inevitable. But tantrums are powerless before the creeping advance of eternal ruin.",
      "üôç": "You slump forward, your discontent simmering like fading embers. The cosmos neither sees nor cares for your displeasure. The collapse proceeds unchallenged.",
      "üôç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "Your wounded pride hangs heavy as the world dissolves. The injuries you carry matter little beside the approaching silence that will erase all grievances alike.",
      "üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "You huff, arms tight, eyes burning‚Äîbut your outrage evaporates beneath the cold certainty of fate. Expect worse. Worse is all that remains.",
      "üíá": "You let the blades shear your hair, as if a change in appearance could reset the unraveling world. But no cosmetic transformation hides the decay beneath your skin.",
      "üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è": "You sit as your hair falls away in silent strands, each lock a thread cut from the loom of fate. No amount of grooming hides the rot gnawing at the foundation.",
      "üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "The scissors glide through your hair, but appearances are illusions. The ruin remains beneath your polished surface, laughing at your desperate attempt to mask impending oblivion.",

      "üôä": "It covers its mouth to avoid danger. You silence yourself not out of wisdom, but because your words would expose your weakness. The monkey shows restraint; you show fear.",
      "üêí": "Still reaching upward, fearing the inevitable fall. The monkey climbs by instinct ‚Äî you scramble in vain ambition, knowing the collapse is coming yet climbing anyway. Pathetic.",
      "üêî": "It flaps and shrieks at every threat ‚Äî and still shows more composure than you do when facing even the smallest challenge. The chicken‚Äôs terror is natural; your fear is self-inflicted.",

      "üêù": "The bee toils endlessly for a distant queen, its sacrifice part of something greater. You labor pointlessly for empty masters who do not even acknowledge you. The bee dies with purpose ‚Äî you, with regret.",
      "ü™±": "The worm writhes unnoticed beneath the earth, faceless and humble. You writhe just as spinelessly, but scream for recognition you‚Äôll never deserve. The worm accepts insignificance; you rage against it.",
      "üêõ": "The caterpillar devours, transforming with purpose, while you consume endlessly and transform only into different shades of failure.",

      "ü™®": "A rock. The bones of the earth, ancient and unyielding, once proud beneath sky and star. And yet you come, armed with blades, drills, and poison, shattering what endured for eons. You split open the planet‚Äôs flesh without reverence, devouring its marrow to feed your industries. The stone itself weeps beneath your feet, but your hunger is deaf to its silent agony.",
      "üåæ": "Wheat. Once a gift of life, offered freely to nourish all creatures beneath the sun. But you ‚Äî you chain even the fields to your greed. You do not grow for life, you grow for profit, for empire, for control. You tear the land into straight rows of servitude, stripping its soul, its wild freedom, and call it 'agriculture.' The soil itself grows weary beneath your endless exploitation.",
      "üíê": "A bouquet. A garland of severed lives, displayed as trophies of your dominance. You rip flowers from their roots, bind them into obedient arrangements, and parade them before each other as symbols of affection ‚Äî affection soaked in death. You cannot let beauty live. You must possess it, cage it, and watch it wither beneath your gaze.",
      "üå∑": "A tulip. So delicate, so innocent in its brief bloom. Yet even this you cannot leave untouched. You pluck it from its soil, parade its corpse, and trade it for fleeting admiration. Nothing is sacred to you. Beauty, to you, is not something to be cherished ‚Äî only something to be bought, sold, and discarded when its color fades.",
      "üåπ": "A rose. Even its thorns cannot deter you. You reach greedily, enduring the sting as you have endured the pain of every life you‚Äôve crushed beneath your heel. The rose bleeds to warn you away, but you tear it apart regardless, as you do with everything that resists your grasp. You do not respect beauty. You devour it.",
      "ü•Ä": "A wilted flower. Once vibrant, now broken. Its fading petals are mirrors of the world you create ‚Äî a place where beauty cannot survive under your relentless appetite. What you touch withers. What you build decays. Even life itself recoils from your presence, yet you call this decay 'civilization.'",
      "ü™ª": "Lavender. Meant to calm, to soothe, to bring peace. But your blood rejects peace. Your hands tear even the gentlest stems from the ground, reducing serenity to mere scent for your restless consumption. You cannot stand harmony ‚Äî you dismantle it, bottle it, and sell it to feed your hollow appetites.",
      "ü™∑": "A lotus. Sacred, rising pure from the filth of the world. Yet your filth grows faster than its purity can rise. You foul the waters, choke the roots, and call yourself master of nature while you drown it in your greed. You will not allow beauty to rise from the mud, only more mud to swallow it whole.",
      "üå∫": "A hibiscus. Vivid, alive, radiant ‚Äî for a moment. But you tear it from its home, marvel briefly at its color, then discard its corpse as you always do. You cannot simply behold life.

But your clouds grow thicker, your hunger deeper, and the sun itself dims behind the smoke of your progress. Even the sky mourns beneath your hand.",
      "üåû": "A smiling sun. It shines upon all, even upon you, desecrator of worlds. But behind its warmth burns sorrow. It watches your blackened skies, your poisoned air, your endless hunger as you devour the world beneath its light. The heavens scream, but you hear nothing beneath your machines.",
      "üåù": "A full moon with face. Cold, distant, watching you with silent horror as you devour the children of the earth. Your cities crawl like parasites beneath its gaze, spreading disease upon the land. The moon bears witness to your crimes, casting pale judgment upon your midnight labors of ruin.",
      "üåõ": "A crescent moon with face. Quiet, gentle, unblinking. It illuminates your secret horrors, the things you hide beneath your machines and walls. But the moon sees all. You cannot escape its cold gaze. Its silence is not forgiveness ‚Äî it is condemnation etched into the very firmament.",
      "üåú": "A waning moon with face. Dimming beneath the blackened skies you craft. Even the celestial lights fade behind your smog and poison. You reach higher, always higher, but everything you touch ‚Äî land, sea, sky ‚Äî you darken. The very stars retreat from your presence.",
      "üåö": "A new moon with face. The darkness itself recoils from your glare. Even the void grows uneasy beneath your unrelenting hunger, for where you walk, not even night is safe from your machines, your lights, your endless expansion. You chase away even the comfort of shadow with your sickly glow.",
      "üåï": "A full moon. The ancient sentinel, hanging high, watching your ruin with silent despair.

It remains silent, not from mercy, but from horror.",
      "üåñ": "A waning gibbous. The light fades, just as the last untouched corners of nature shrink beneath your crawling dominion. With every harvest, every bulldozer, every pipeline, you extinguish what once flourished. The moon weeps for the vanishing wilds.",
      "üåó": "A last quarter moon. Once the world stood in balance. Now the scales tip toward absence, toward emptiness. You carve the flesh from the land, drain its rivers, and call your gluttony 'growth.' But even the heavens feel the weight of your excess.",
      "üåò": "A waning crescent. A faint sliver remains, like the tattered edge of nature's last refuge. But your greed presses forward. You will not rest until even that fragile hope is consumed by your insatiable engines of ruin.",
      "üåë": "A new moon. True darkness. But even this void is not born from nature ‚Äî it is the shadow cast by your endless greed, your towering cities, your burning skies. You snuff out every light, blind to the emptiness you breed.",
      "üåí": "A waxing crescent. A tender beginning, barely clinging to existence ‚Äî much like life beneath your dominion. You see such fragile beauty, and already your hand reaches to claim, to profit, to dismantle. No sprout escapes your shadow.",
      "üåì": "A first quarter moon. Half in shadow, half illuminated ‚Äî much like your hollow morals, masquerading as virtue while your industries pillage and poison. You pretend to balance, yet always your hunger tips you toward ruin.",
      "üåî": "A waxing gibbous. Growing fuller, heavier, bloated ‚Äî like your empires swollen on stolen blood, on stolen earth. You do not build ‚Äî you devour. And still you look to the stars for your next victim.",
      "üåô": "A crescent moon. Serene in its sky, peaceful in its arc ‚Äî until your rockets, your satellites, your endless machines pierce even this sanctuary. You cannot allow anything to simply exist. You infect even the heavens.",
      "üåé": "Earth (Americas). Scarred, bleeding, carved apart under your empires. Forests stripped, rivers strangled, mountains gutted ‚Äî the land cries beneath your iron grasp, yet still you declare yourselves masters.",
      "üåç": "Earth (Europe-Africa). The birthplace of conquest, the cradle of your endless hunger. You spread like a blight across continents, shattering ancient lands, enslaving life under your insatiable thirst for power.",
      "üåè": "Earth (Asia-Australia). Rich lands stripped bare, oceans drained, creatures slaughtered ‚Äî and still you want more. Even the furthest shores are not safe from your grasping fingers, your choking smoke.",
      "ü™ê": "A ringed planet. You stare to the distant stars, dreaming of conquest beyond while your home rots beneath your feet. You will not learn. You will simply export your ruin to every world you touch.",
      "üí´": "Dizzy star. You stumble forward, blinded not by fate, but by your own spiraling greed. Even as you destroy the ground beneath you, you imagine yourselves invincible, eternal. But nothing escapes the fall you bring.",
      "‚≠ê": "A star. Distant, pure, untouchable ‚Äî for now. Unlike your own tainted existence, it burns freely, unscarred by your machines. But I see your eyes upon it, planning already how to desecrate even the stars.",
      "üåü": "A glowing star. Bright and defiant, far from your reach. It shines where your claws cannot yet grasp. But given time, you would strip even these distant suns if it fed your unholy appetites.",
      "‚ú®": "Sparkles. Cheap decorations to disguise your rot. You throw glitter over your collapsing world and pretend it shines. But beneath your hollow lights lies only decay.",

      "üåà": "A rainbow. A brief, fragile arc of beauty daring to exist amidst the filth you spew into the skies. You stand in awe, yet do nothing to stop the poison rising beneath it. Soon even this fleeting miracle will fade, as you choke the heavens.",
      "‚òÄÔ∏è": "The sun. The ancient giver of life, still shining despite your parasitic reign. You drain its gifts, turn its warmth into profit, and throw shadows across lands that once flourished freely beneath its light.",
